## Front-end (React ⚛️)

[🎥 React.js: The Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pDqJVdNa44) brings you the full story behind the early days of React, focusing on the dedicated group of developers who helped bring it to the world stage.

### What is the need of node.js ?

**To run react we need Node.js**. First, Chrome's V8 Engine refers to Google Chrome's JavaScript engine. The browser's JavaScript engine is responsible for reading, understanding, and breaking down JavaScript into machine code in order to run it. Second, the runtime refers to the state at which JavaScript runs in the browser.

Essentially, Node.js packages the runtime state for JavaScript usage outside of the browser.

Now, we can write JavaScript not only for the browser, but also as a general programming language to write our **scripts** to **running our servers**.
